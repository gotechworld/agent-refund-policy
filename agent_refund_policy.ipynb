From the initial search, it appears that United Airlines generally allows for a refund if you cancel your flight up to 24 hours before the scheduled departure time. However, for specific cancellations made 2 hours prior to departure, the eligibility for a refund might depend on the type of ticket purchased (refundable vs. non-refundable) and other specific terms and conditions outlined by the airline. For the most accurate and detailed information, it would be best to directly contact United Airlines customer service or review their official refund policy page, particularly focusing on sections that address cancellations close to the time of departure."
